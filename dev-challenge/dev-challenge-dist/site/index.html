    <h2>Assumptions</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>I assumed that sorting should be in ascending order by last changed bid</li>
        <li>I assumed that we need to show sparkline in last column of every row</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Approach</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Created utils.js module using CommonJS, which contains all the required functions</li>
        <li>To avoid re-rendering of table I am finding the index where new data has to be inserted and adding the row at that particular index of table</li>
        <li>Added timestamp attribute in each received object, to manage last 30 seconds data to be shown as a sparkline</li>
        <li>Added jasmine for unit testing</li>
        <li>By default jasmine don't show report of successful unit tests, So I have modified the report to show success logs with details</li>
        <li>You can find the test files in "spec/test_files" location</li>   
    </ul>
